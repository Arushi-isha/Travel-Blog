                <p>Rome is Italy’s most popular destination in terms of both incoming and domestic visitors, due to its wide range of historical and cultural heritage sites. After 30 centuries of history, including barbarian invasions and enemy occupations, the Italian capital is now facing the pressures of mass tourism. Due to a large number of historical monuments in the region, Rome is particularly vulnerable.</p>
                <p>Ancient Rome’s ruins are dispersed throughout the historic center and shape a travel itinerary that is part of the open-air experience of the region. The city’s iconic squares also lead to a network of interconnected open spaces. The main sights of Rome: the Colosseum, the Forum, the Vatican Museums, St. Peter’s Basilica, the Pantheon.</p>
                <p>Rome’s numerous heritage sites have been a symbol of the Roman Empire over the centuries, a religious center, a significant archaeological hub and artistic limelight. Rome holds some of the most important works of medieval art, Renaissance and Baroque, Neoclassicism and even Fascist Architecture, in addition to the formidable ruins of the Roman Empire, therefore, cultural tourism and religious tourism contributes to a big part of Rome’s tourism industry.</p>

                <h7 id="iceland" style="font-weight: bold;font-size: 50px;"><br>Ice Land</h7>
                <p>Iceland's location on the top of the world also ensures that it is among the best places to see the northern lights or aurora borealis. These spectacular celestial wonders are commonly seen in Iceland from September to mid-April and are among the top reasons to visit Iceland outside of the bright summer months. On a still winter night, you are likely to see the mystical green lights dancing in the clear sky above Reykjavík, but your chances of witnessing them increase if you head out of town, away from electric lighting and the disturbance of the city.Many experienced guides specialize in northern lights tours. Seeking out the best nightly sightings and going northern lights hunting can be equally thrilling as seeing the spectacular celestial show itself. </p>
